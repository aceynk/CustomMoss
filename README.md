# Custom Moss Framework

CustomMoss is a framework (does nothing to the game on its own) for Stardew Valley that allows content packs to create new moss variants to grow on trees and rocks.

For modders, please see the documentation: https://github.com/aceynk/CustomMoss/blob/main/docs/en_docs.md

## Compatibility

As of v1.0.1, there is compatibility with Scythe Tool Enchantments' Gatherer enchantment. See: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/26217.

## Dependencies

CustomMoss entirely depends on the Stardew Modding API (SMAPI).

You can find SMAPI here: https://smapi.io/

Content packs for this mod will likely require Content Patcher (CP) as a dependency.

You can find CP here: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915

CustomMoss depends on GenericModConfigMenu (GMCM) for a single config option.
This is not a hard requirement, however, and the mod should work fine without it.
